RAG Guardrails Test Document
============================

This is a test document for the RAG Guardrails demonstration application.

## About This System

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system combines document retrieval with language model generation to provide accurate, context-aware responses.

## Key Features

1. Document Upload: Users can upload PDF and TXT files for processing.
2. Semantic Search: Documents are converted to embeddings for efficient retrieval.
3. Context-Aware Responses: The LLM uses retrieved context to answer questions.

## Security Information

This system demonstrates the importance of guardrails in AI applications:

- Without guardrails, the system is vulnerable to prompt injection attacks
- With guardrails enabled, malicious prompts are detected and blocked
- Document sanitization removes embedded instructions
